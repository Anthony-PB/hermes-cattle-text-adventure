> *"Born at dawn. Played the lyre by noon. Stole the cattle of Apollo in the evening."*
> — *Homeric Hymn to Hermes*

**Project Maia** is a Python-based interactive fiction engine that retells the origin story of Hermes. It gamifies the distinction between **Metis** (cunning intelligence) and **Bia** (violent force), forcing the player to think like a Trickster God to survive.

## 🏛️ The Concept

In Greek Mythology, Hermes is the god of boundaries, exchange, and *techne* (technology). He does not fight with muscles; he fights with code, logic, and loopholes.

* **The Goal:** Ascend from a cave-dwelling infant to an Olympian God.
* **The Obstacle:** Apollo (The All-Seeing Sun).
* **The Weapon:** Your wits.

## 📜 The "Patch Notes" (Mythology)

This game engine maps specific mythological motifs to game logic:

| Feature | Mythological Motif | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stage 1** | *Techne* (Invention) | Turning a tortoise into the first Lyre. |
| **Stage 2** | *Boundaries* (Theft) | Stealing exactly 50 cows (showing restraint/precision) vs. greedy theft. |
| **Stage 3** | *The Trickster* | Using the "Backward Tracks" exploit to hack Apollo's tracking. |
| **Stage 4** | *Sacrifice* | The "Hunger Test." Refusing to eat meat to prove divinity. |
| **Stage 5** | *Reconciliation* | Resolving conflict through exchange (Trade), not war. |

## 🧠 Why "Project Maia"?

Maia is the mother of Hermes, a nymph who lived in a deep, dark cave to avoid the eyes of the other gods. She represents **secrecy** and **stealth**.
